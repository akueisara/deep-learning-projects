## Project 1 - [Predicting Bike-Sharing Data](https://github.com/akueisara/deep-learning-nanodegree-udacity/blob/master/project-bikesharing/Your_first_neural_network.ipynb)

- Implement a neural network in NumPy to predict bike rentals. 
- The data comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset).

## Project 2 - [CNN Project: Dog Breed Classifier](https://github.com/akueisara/deep-learning-nanodegree-udacity/blob/master/project-dog/dog_app.ipynb)

- Build a convolutional neural network with PyTorch to classify any image (even an image of a face) as a specific dog breed.

## Project 3 - [Generate TV Scripts](https://github.com/akueisara/deep-learning-projects/blob/master/project-generate-tv-scripts/dlnd_tv_script_generation.ipynb)

- Train a recurrent neural network to generate scripts in the style of dialogue from [Seinfeld](https://www.kaggle.com/thec03u5/seinfeld-chronicles#scripts.csv).

## Project 4 - [Face Generation](https://github.com/akueisara/deep-learning-projects/blob/master/project-face-generation/dlnd_face_generation.ipynb)

- Use generative adversarial networks to generate new images of faces.

## Project 5 - [Deploying a Sentiment Analysis Model
](https://github.com/akueisara/deep-learning-projects/blob/master/project-deploying-a-sentiment-analysis-model/SageMaker+Project.ipynb)

- A recurrent neural network for the purpose of determining the sentiment of a movie review using the IMDB data set. The deployed model uses Amazon's SageMaker service to construct a simple web app that interacts with it.
